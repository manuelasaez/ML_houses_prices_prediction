# Machine learining houses prices prediction
## Motivation: 
What factors influence the price of a property? A detailed analysis using statistical or machine learning models can help predict the final price of each home based on the specific attributes of properties in Ames, Iowa. The price of a property can be influenced by various factors, including but not limited to:
1. **Location**: Proximity to schools, parks, shopping centers, and employment opportunities.
2. **Size of the Property**: Including the total area, number of rooms, and overall square footage.
3. **Age and Condition**: The year the house was built and the condition of the property (e.g., any recent renovations or need for repairs).
4. **Amenities**: Features such as swimming pools, garages, fireplaces, and other desirable amenities.
5. **Neighborhood Characteristics**: The general appeal of the neighborhood, crime rates, and the quality of the local school district.
6. **Market Conditions**: The current state of the real estate market, including supply and demand dynamics.
7. **Economic Factors**: Interest rates, local economic conditions, and employment rates.
8. **Legal and Zoning Issues**: Local regulations, property taxes, and any zoning laws that might affect the property's use.
9. **Environmental Factors**: Exposure to noise, pollution, and natural hazards like flood zones or proximity to industrial areas.


## Goal:  
To predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, I predict the value of the SalePrice variable. 

## Technical details:
In this project I conduct a descriptive analysis of the data sets using wrangling techniques, descriptive statistics and visualizations. Also, I applied machine learning models as regression trees and random forest to do the predictions. 

Libraries:

- **pandas**
- **Numpy**
- **seaborn**
- **matplotlib**
- **scikit-learn**
